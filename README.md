# cross_section_analysis

"Cross-section analysis" is an advanced beam section calculator.
"Cross-section analysis" can be used to determine the cross-sectional torsion and flexural structural properties,
including torsion constant and warping constant and to visualise cross-sectional stresses resulting from combinations
of applied forces and bending moments. "Cross-section analysis" is an useful tool for stress engineers for design and
analysis of metal materials sections.
